title: Diacritical Mark Not Available
---
I sometimes write in french my subtitles, and in french we have a lot of [diacritical Mark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diacritic) ([signe diacritique](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diacritique) comme les accents, tréma et cédille).
In rare case, the font does not support the [acute accent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_accent) or other diacritals marks.

## How to know if a font support these marks

The first thing I do is I write it normally in [aegisub](http://www.aegisub.org/). 
After I add my font on my OS (see [Adding fonts to a Linux OS](../Adding-Font/)), I check it with Aegisub (File > Fonts Collector > Check fonts for availability and click on **start**).
When a font is not available, just add it.
Else if the font can't show your mark, it's written...
