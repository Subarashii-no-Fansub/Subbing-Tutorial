title: The Cost Behind a Subbing Group
excerpt: <!--more-->
---
{{post.excerpt}}
<br>I'm really interresting about this topic.
Because I hate seing fan to pay for a non-legal thing that doesn't really help the ones who made all the TV show!

In the SnF, the cost for the subs is very low: ~$10 per month for 1To of data for a personnal dedicated server.
<br>But in an other hand:

* we have no encode server; we don't really encode but use existing encode.<br>If one day we must to encode, a personnal computer will be sufficient.
* we don't have storage server. Even if our total size of project is less than 1To, I seed it for 3/4 months only.<br>If one day you want my release, you must to download the encode + the pack of subtitles/font and mux them.
* we have a website on GitHub.<br>I sometimes use hostinger to host a few file (*free* account) + sync.com services (*free* account too)

## Other extras

Some groups only ask donation for paying BD. It's not my goal to explain this kind of expense.<br>I prefer to annalyze the cost of the architecture.

### For DameDesuYo:

They use IRC for chatting (a public channel + a private channel); <br>
<table>
	<tr>
		<th></th>
		<th>Cost ($/month)</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Encode Server</td>
		<td>54.12</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Storage/FTP</td>
		<td>54.5</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Site</td>
		<td>3.49</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Seedbox</td>
		<td>13</td>
	</tr>
</table>

We can see that a simple site that receiving more than 20 000 visitors pay a low price (using cloudflare, a *free* account I think + the cheapest namecheap's Shared Hosting offer), and a normal-price seedbox!<br>
For encode server, it's their choice that I don't really agree. I hope one day this kind of server will be sharing between all the subbing group to be less expensive.<br>And for storage/ftp server, to receive big file (like .ts or .iso for BDMV) and store all their release, it's expensive!

### For others fansubs

They buy in general a dedicated server (for FTP/XDCC/Storage).
<br>Some have that at ~18€ per months for 2TB. Others have money and buy approximatively 80€/months (RDP server to encode + dedicated server) + dedicated server for hosting (25€).
<br>Hosting can be done in a blog-enterprise if content is not really licensed…
